**Project Name:**
Advanced SEO MCP Server

**Project URL:**
https://github.com/halilertekin/advanced-seo-mcp

**Start Date:**
January 2025

**Description:**
I developed an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that empowers AI agents (like Claude, Cursor, and Gemini) with professional-grade SEO capabilities.

**Key Features:**
*   **Technical & On-Page Audits:** Automates checks for meta tags, broken links, schema markup validation, and heading hierarchy.
*   **Performance Analysis:** Integrated with Google PageSpeed Insights API to fetch real-time Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
*   **Competitor Intelligence:** Leverages Ahrefs data (via CapSolver) to analyze backlinks, Domain Rating (DR), and organic traffic estimations.
*   **Automated Reporting:** Generates comprehensive Markdown audit reports with a single command.

This tool bridges the gap between AI code generation and technical SEO analysis, allowing developers to automate complex site audits directly within their AI-assisted workflows.
