**Headline:** Give Your AI Agents "SEO Eyes" with Advanced SEO MCP! 🚀

AI assistants like Cursor, Claude, and Gemini are fantastic at writing code, but they often fly blind when it comes to real-time SEO analysis. Today, I'm thrilled to announce my open-source project: **Advanced SEO MCP Server**.

Now, your AI agent can analyze any website like a professional SEO expert with a single command.

**🛠️ What Can It Do?**
✅ **On-Page Analysis:** Deep dive into Meta tags, Heading hierarchy (H1-H6), and content density.
✅ **Technical Audit:** Detect Broken Links, Schema Markup errors, Robots.txt, and Sitemap issues.
✅ **Ahrefs Intelligence:** (Powered by CapSolver) Retrieve Backlinks, Domain Rating (DR), and Traffic estimates.
✅ **Speed Test:** Real-time Core Web Vitals via Google PageSpeed Insights API.
✅ **Competitor Analysis:** Head-to-head comparison of your site vs. competitors.

All delivered as a single Python package with an **Auto-Markdown Reporting** feature.

**👨‍💻 Who is this for?**
*   Developers building custom SEO tools.
*   Agencies automating workflows with Cursor or Claude Desktop.
*   Anyone tired of manual SEO checks.

**📦 Installation:**
`pip install advanced-seo-mcp`
