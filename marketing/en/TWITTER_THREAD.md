# Twitter Thread Draft

**Tweet 1:**
Your AI agents (Cursor, Claude) can write code, but do they know SEO? 🤖📉

Introducing "Advanced SEO MCP": A tool that lets your AI audit websites, fetch Ahrefs data, check PageSpeed scores, and find technical errors instantly.

Open Source & Python-based. 👇

**Tweet 2:**
Features:
🔍 On-Page Audit (H1, Meta, Thin Content)
🚀 Google PSI Speed Test (Core Web Vitals)
🔗 Ahrefs Data (Backlinks, DR, Traffic) - CapSolver integrated!
🛠️ Technical (Schema Validator, Broken Link Checker)

All with one command: `generate_audit_report`

**Tweet 3:**
Why did I build this?
I was tired of switching between my browser and editor. Now I just tell Cursor: "Compare my site with my competitor," and it fetches the data and presents a Markdown table right in my IDE.

**Tweet 4:**
Installation is easy:
`pip install advanced-seo-mcp`

Then run the `setup_extension.py` script and add it to your Cursor/Claude config.
